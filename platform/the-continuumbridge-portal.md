# The ContinuumBridge Portal
The ContinuumBridge portal is your view onto what apps and devices are installed on your bridges. It allows you to "discover" devices and add apps that can use them. The paragraphs below take you through this process using the Demo Switch App example.

## Logging-in
On any computer, open a browser and navigate to:

http://portal.continuumbridge.com/

Once you have logged-in, your browser should look similar to the picture below with name of your bridge near the top-left of the screen (in this case, “My Bridge”).

## Adding bridge-apps
Click on the Install Apps button. A pop-up will appear similar to that shown below. From this, install Demo Switch App and press close. The app will appear in the list of apps on the left of the browser window.

> No Apps?
> A few default apps are installed when you create a new bridge. At present, this sometimes does not happen. If you don't see any, please email us at info.continuumbridge.com and we'll fix it.

## "Discovering" devices
Now ensure that the devices that you want to use are on. Z-wave devices are generally included in a network by either pressing a button once or three times. Refer to the instruction of the specific device. Now press the “Connect to Device” button, and do whatever is required to your device to put it into discovery/inclusion mode. After a delay of up to 30 seconds, the display will show any devices that have been found. Status updates and instruction are displayed in the Bridge Messages window. An example of this is given below. Here a Vision Security 258 Z-wave device has been found, along with two devices mysteriously named “Continuum”, which are actually TI Sensortags that have been reprogrammed by ContinuumBridge.

Only one device may be installed at a time. With Z-wave devices, only one will be displayed. With Bluetooth devices, you may see many and a lot of devices (eg: some smartphones) will appear, but only try to install the device you are intending to install. 

> Z-wave devices
> Make sure the device is within a few metres of the bridge before trying to discover/include it. Once it is installed on the bridge, you can move it away.

> Sometimes you may see a status message saying that a Z-wave device has been found, but then it is not identified. This can occur for a number of reasons, including a poor radio connection. If this happens, press the Z-exclude button on the portal and then the include/exclude button on the device (in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions). Then try again.
