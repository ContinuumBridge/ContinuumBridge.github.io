# Bridge Setup
Spur buttons communicate wirelessly with a bridge. Bridges are usually connected to the Internet, and hence ContinuumBridge's servers, using a mobile network, although there is provision to connected via the integral Ethernet port. 

1. Plug the power supply into a wall socket and connect it to the bridge.

2. The LED on the bridge should start to blink after about a minute. This may take longer the first time it is plugged it. This indicates that the bridge is functioning. After another minutes or two, the LED should become solid, indicating that the bridge is connected to the mobile network. Again, this may take longer the first time the bridge is plugged in as it may need to connect to a new mobile network.
