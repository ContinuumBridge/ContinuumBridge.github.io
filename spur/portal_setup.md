# Connecting a Spur Button to the Spur Portal

In a web browser, go to the site: portal.spur.site and enter the user name and password that you have been provided with. If you do not have a user name and password, please contact your ContinuumBridge representative or email info@continuumbridge.com.

</p>

Once you've signed-in, push the ADD BUTTON button at the top right of the screen:

<p align="center">

</p>

Fill in the form that pops up. The ID is the Node ID of the Spur button that you want to connect. This should be displayed on the screen of the Spur button when you take it out of its box. You can give the button any name you like, but we suggest keeping the name to 20 characters or less as you may want to show it on the screen of the Spur button. In most cases, you will give the button the name of its location. In this example, the location is "Shower Room". A screenset defines what your button will display, both before an after it is pushed. There is a lot more about screensets in the Spur User Manual. For now, just select one of the default screensets from the drop-down menu. In this example, the "Clean" screenset has been selected.

Push "ADD BUTTON". The following screen will be displayed:

Now return to the Spur button. As it says on the screen, push it for three seconds (or more):

</p>

The screen of the button will display a message saying that it's connecting to the network. Don't worry if this takes up to about a minute. Once it has conencted, it will download its software, which can take another minute or more, but will usually be quicker. At the end of the process, it displays the following message:

</p>

You can configure a lot of buttons in a central location and leave them in this state for subsequent installation. Each will be displaying its name, which should tell an installer where to locate it.

Once the button is connected to the network, the signal strength will be displayed on the Spur portal:

</p>

The signal strength indicator works in the same way as a mobile phone signal strength indicator. See the User Manual for more details. 

When you are ready to start using the button, double-push, which is two pushes within about half a second of each other, and it will display its first operational screen:
