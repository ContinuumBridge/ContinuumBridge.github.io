## Quick Start
Spur buttons communicate wirelessly with a gateway (which we call a bridge, largely because our company name has a "Bridge" in it). To install a Spur button and get it working you need to do the following:

1. [Setup the bridge](bridge_setup.md)

2. [Install a Spur Button](button_install.md)

3. [Connect the Spur Button to the Spur Portal](portal_setup.md)

## Spur User Guide
These pages contain all you need to know to connect and configre Spur buttons, including the basics of how to make the screensets that configure their operation. 

[Go to the Spur User Guide](user_guide.md)

## Spur Developer Guide
This is a more detailed guide that gives details of how to connect Spur to a variety of APIs, including the IBM Watson IoT Platform.
