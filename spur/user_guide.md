# Spur User Guide
## Introduction
The basics of connecting a Spur button and selecting an application (screenset) for it are covered in the [Quick Start Guide](spur_overview.md). It is assumed that if you are reading this document you will already be familiar with this. The things that are covered in this document are:

* [Overview of the Spur Portal](#overview-of-the-spur-portal)
* [Creating Screensets](#screensets)
* [Spur Button Operation](#operation)

## Overview of the Spur Portal
### Terminology

The Spur Portal, [portal.spur.site](http:www.portal.spur.site) enabled configuration and montoring of Spur buttons. The essential ingredients of the Spur portal are:

* Screensets. A screenset is essentially a flow chart that defines what text appears of the display of a button, how the button moves from one display to another (eg: by pushing on the left side) and what actions are triggered by these changes. Here is an example of a screenset which causes a text message to be sent when someone pushes the button.

* Buttons. Each physical button is registed on the Spur portal and assigned a screenset.
* Lists. Buttons are grouped together in lists. List normally contain buttons of a similar function, usually in the same location. The example below shows bays in a warehouse.

### Using the Spur Portal

When you first sign in to the Spur portal, the screen will look like this:

</p>

This shows a blank list, with the navigation menu on the left-hand side. From here you can:

* Add buttons, as described in the [Quick Start Guide](portal_setup.md).
* Change the name of the list by clicking on its name ("List A", at the top left) and deleting/typing.
* Set the defaults for the list, by clicking on "DEFAULTS". The defaults consist of a screenset name, a default email address and a default phone number (for SMS).
* Create new lists, by clicking on "+ ADD LIST".
* Go to the users screen, the screensets screen or sign out, by clicking on the relevant buttons in the navigation menu.
